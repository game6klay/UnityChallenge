Guidelines:

1. I have chosen BackEnd Section with the mandatory CS fundamentals. I have used Java throughout.
2. I have two packages and csfundamentals and backend in the src folder where the respected solutions.
3. tests contains implementation Unit test for every solution.
4. For the Logger Subclass problem please run the LoggerExample first to create the logs.log file once and then run the LoggerExampleTestOne.
5. For Concurrency problem get("k1") would print the v2 when we start the thread and apply the join() method. Otherwise it can print either values randomly based on which thread finishes the execution first. I have implemented code for this problem and with brief explanation of the working in the comments.

Looking forward for your feedback :)
